Tree\[+T]
===

This is a micro-library for Scala providing 
a general purpose, covariant, immutable, linked tree-like data structure with rich API.

Motivation
---

A Tree is a one of the most useful data structure concepts 
with numerous flavours and implementations. 

This library implements the version, where the tree can be 
either empty or a node. Each node has a value, and links to zero or more subtrees.

Dependencies
---

Depends only on a standard, built-in Scala library.

Cross-compilation to Scala versions `2.13.1`, `2.12.10`, and `2.11.12` is provided.

API
---

Provided API allows for a rich set of queries and operations on the tree.
